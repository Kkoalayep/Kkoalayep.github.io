Here is **Ao Xiao (Oscar, 肖傲)**.<br>

Welcome to my blog! I am a postgraduate student in the Department of Robotics at the University of Manchester. Robotics is a very cutting-edge subject field at present, which will undoubtedly be a little difficult, but I enjoy the fun of overcoming difficulties, and I am very honored that you can watch the continuous progress of my study.<br>

## Research Interests

**I am actively seeking an entry position in the robotics program for Fall 2025. If you have any information, please contact me!**

My current research focuses on ROS2 and machine learning. My interest is **machine learning** and its application in **robotics**. In short, advanced technologies such as ML and ROS2 have a positive impact on everyone's life. I hope to dedicate my talents to this meaningful cause and bring benefits to society.
