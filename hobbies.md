# Hobbies

## Swimming 


<br>I have loved swimming since I was a child, and I was lucky to have a happy family that allowed me to swim whenever I wanted (so much so that I got a little tired of it for a while), and I also won a gold medal in sports in college, which I was very happy about

## PLAY!!!

<br>I like playing computer games, reading novels and comics very much, I know they affect my study a little, but doing them in my spare time really makes me happy.
